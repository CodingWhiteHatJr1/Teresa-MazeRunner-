        <p> Teresa was the last person WICKED sent into the maze. All they boys were astonished when they saw that a girl enetered the maze. Teresa helped Thomas find the way out of the maze. Apperantley she realized that both Thomas and her were working for WICKED. Once they escaped the maze, they went to the Scorch. The Scorch gave Teresa some of her memory, she remebered that she worked for WICKED and Thomas sat right in front of her. Once the Brain Virus started spreading, Teres wanted to find a cure, so she turned over to the bad side, WICKED. In death cure, Teresa was finding a cure with the second person whose Immune was strong, Minho. She betrayed her friends and was helping WICKED find a cure. After Thomas captured her and used her as a tool to get inside the building she was very disturbed. After a while, Teresa realized that she has been doing the wrong thing, she took Minho to use his blood to find a cure, it was not Minho's blood, it was Thomas's. She told him, I can make a cure and made one. Before she could send it out in the world, she died saving Thomas's life and realizing she did the wrong thing. <br> Teresa inspired me because even though all her friends ran away from the Scorch, she went back and made a cure for everyone. She also gave a big lesson, never betray your friends, and those who you love. She taught us that to do what you think is right, she inspired me because she did what she thought was correct, even though all her friends turned their backs on her. </p>
